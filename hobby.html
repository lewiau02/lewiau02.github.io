<h1><b>Hobbies</b></h1>
<p>I am a huge fan of wrestling and it is my favorite sport.</p>
<p>Another passion of mine is showing sheep across the country with my family as I am the 3rd generation and we currently have 2nd longest farm in our breed.</p>
<p>I love snowmobiling, jetskiing, and boating.</p>
<h2><b>Basic Info</b></h2>
<p>I am a doer, not a watcher.</p>
<p>I don't ask for help rarely, unless I am beyond confused.</p>
<p>I love being right. I am most of the time, but when I'm not. I'll admit it.</p>
